Coin Flip Streaks
For this exercise, we’ll try doing an experiment. If you flip a coin 100 times and write down an “H” for each
heads and “T” for each tails, you’ll create a list that looks like “T T T T H H H H T T.” If you ask a human
to make up 100 random coin flips, you’ll probably end up with alternating head-tail results like “H T H T
H H T H T T,” which looks random (to humans), but isn’t mathematically random. A human will almost
never write down a streak of six heads or six tails in a row, even though it is highly likely to happen in truly
random coin flips. Humans are predictably bad at being random. Write a program to find out how often a streak of six heads or a streak of six tails comes up in a randomly
generated list of heads and tails. Your program breaks up the experiment into two parts: the first part
generates a list of randomly selected 'heads' and 'tails' values, and the second part checks if there is a streak
in it. Put all of this code in a loop that repeats the experiment 10,000 times so we can find out what
percentage of the coin flips contains a streak of six heads or tails in a row. As a hint, the function call
random.randint(0, 1) will return a 0 value 50% of the time and a 1 value the other 50% of the time.


import random
coin_sides = ["heads", "tails"]
tries = 100000000
tcount = hcount = inarow = 0
buffer = []
times = 25

for i in range(tries):
    flip = random.choice(coin_sides)
    buffer.append(flip)
    if flip=="heads":
        hcount+=1
    elif flip=="tails":
        tcount+=1
        
    if len(buffer)==times:
        if "heads" not in buffer and buffer:
            inarow+=1
            buffer = []
        if "tails" not in buffer and buffer:
            inarow+=1
            buffer = []
        if buffer:
            buffer.pop(0)

print(f"Heads counted: {hcount}; Tails counted:{tcount}; Times heads or tails were {times} in a row:{inarow}")
print(f"The chance of the coin landing {times} times in a row on the same side was: {inarow/tries*100}%")
